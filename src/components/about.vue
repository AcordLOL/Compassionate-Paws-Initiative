            We are a group of students committed to promoting animal welfare and ensuring that every animal is treated with kindness, care, and respect. While animals may play different roles in our lives as pets, companions, or working partners  they should never experience cruelty or neglect.
Through education and awareness, we advocate for responsible treatment, including proper food, safe shelter, and necessary medical care.
As students, we believe that compassion starts with us and small actions can lead to meaningful change.
Because how we treat animals reflects the kind of society we choose to build
